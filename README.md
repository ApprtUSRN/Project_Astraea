This is an all in one auditing software aimed towards helping lessening the process in auditing via importing files and generating an automated report.

The only feature available right now is sales reconciliation and you can import your files by following the template located on the template folder.

The database template is for the spell checking feature which allows the auditor to input registered customers and their TINs. This will then highlight the unregistered names to blue which would indicate that either the customer is not registered in the database or the name is mispelled or the numbers don't match the TIN.

The steps for proper use is to.
1. Import a desired database which would then add a file location that would be attached to your account.
2. Import the following files to each of the sections which a file location would appear and this could also be imported manually.
3. Hit generate report once all the desired files are complete.
4. To export the files, you simply need to hit the export button.
5. Done.
